After a moment of contemplation, you decide to leave the dagger where it lies. Your instincts tell you that in this mystical forest, not everything is as it seems. Perhaps this beautiful weapon is meant for another hero, or maybe it serves some greater purpose here in this clearing.

As you step back from the dagger, you could swear you hear a faint whisper on the wind, almost like a sigh. Whether it's disappointment or relief, you can't be sure.

You take one last look at the gleaming dagger before turning away. The weight of your decision sits heavily on your mind as you continue your journey through the Whispering Forest.
