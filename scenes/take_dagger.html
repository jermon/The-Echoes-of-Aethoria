You reach down and grasp the hilt of the dagger. As your fingers close around it, you feel a subtle warmth spreading through your hand. The blade comes free from the earth with surprising ease, almost as if it were eager to be wielded once more.

As you examine the dagger more closely, you notice that its balance is perfect, and the edge is remarkably sharp despite its apparent age. You can't shake the feeling that this weapon might be more than it appears.

You carefully secure the dagger to your belt, feeling a little more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.
