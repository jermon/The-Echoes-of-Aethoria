<h2>Lost in the Void</h2>

<p>As you venture deeper into the unknown, a strange mist engulfs you. The world around you shifts and blurs, and for a moment, you feel as if you've stepped between realities.</p>

<p>You've wandered into a part of Aethoria that doesn't exist - or perhaps it once did, but has been consumed by the Void.</p>

<p>Your Ranger instincts tell you that lingering here could be dangerous. It's best to retrace your steps and return to familiar ground.</p>
