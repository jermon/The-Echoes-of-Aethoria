# The Echoes of Aethoria

## Synopsis

In "The Echoes of Aethoria," you play as Lyra, the last surviving member of the Aethorian Rangers. Your homeland has been overrun by the shadow-wraiths of the Void, and you must embark on a perilous journey to recover the five Astral Shards. These ancient artifacts, when combined, have the power to banish the Void and restore light to your world.

## Gameplay Mechanics

3. **Inventory Management**: Players can collect items throughout their journey, which are stored using web local storage or cookies. This allows for persistent inventory between play sessions.

4. **Character Development**: As players progress, they can improve Lyra's skills in areas such as Archery, Stealth, Survival, and Magic. These skills influence both combat and non-combat encounters.
